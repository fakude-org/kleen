# Agent Guidelines for Kleen Project

This document outlines essential information for AI agents working in the `kleen` repository.

## Project Overview

This is a TypeScript project utilizing Vite for development, building, and previewing. It appears to be a basic web application. The presence of `deno.lock` suggests Deno might be used for certain tasks, but the primary development workflow is driven by Node.js and `package.json` scripts.

## Essential Commands

The following commands are defined in `package.json` and are crucial for working with this codebase:

*   **`npm install`**: Installs project dependencies. This should be run after cloning the repository or after any changes to `package.json`.
*   **`npm run dev`**: Starts the development server using Vite. This command enables hot-module reloading and serves the application locally.
*   **`npm run build`**: Compiles the TypeScript code and bundles the project for production using `tsc` (TypeScript compiler) and Vite. The output will be placed in the `dist/` directory.
*   **`npm run preview`**: Serves the production build locally, allowing you to check the optimized output before deployment.

## Code Organization and Structure

*   **`/src`**: Contains all the application's source code.
    *   `src/main.ts`: The main entry point of the application.
    *   `src/style.css`: Global styles for the application.
    *   `src/counter.ts`: An example module/component demonstrating code structure.
*   **`/public`**: Contains static assets that are served directly (e.g., `vite.svg`, which is currently in `src/`).
*   **`/dist`**: The output directory for production builds. This directory is generated by `npm run build`.
*   **`package.json`**: Defines project metadata, scripts, and dependencies.
*   **`tsconfig.json`**: TypeScript configuration file.

## Naming Conventions and Style Patterns

*   **Language**: The project is written in TypeScript. Adhere to TypeScript best practices.
*   **File Naming**: Follow conventional naming for web projects (e.g., `main.ts`, `style.css`). Specific component or module files should be clearly named (e.g., `counter.ts`).
*   **Code Style**: No specific linter or formatter is explicitly defined in `package.json`. Agents should infer code style from existing files and maintain consistency.

## Testing Approach and Patterns

No dedicated testing framework or scripts are currently defined in `package.json`. If testing is required, a suitable framework (e.g., Vitest, Jest) would need to be integrated.

## Important Gotchas / Non-obvious Patterns

*   **Deno vs. Node.js**: While `deno.lock` is present, the primary build and run commands (`npm run dev`, `npm run build`) are Node.js-based. Prioritize Node.js/Vite workflows unless Deno-specific tasks are explicitly requested or identified.
*   **Vite Configuration**: Vite uses `vite.config.ts` (if present) for configuration. There is no explicit config file, so default Vite behavior is expected.
*   **TypeScript Version**: The `devDependencies` specify `"typescript": "~5.9.3"`. Ensure compatibility if modifying TypeScript-related configurations or syntax.
